It provides tools for designing, simulating, and running quantum algorithms on local simulators and real quantum hardware. Today, we'll use `Qiskit` to program and visualize quantum circuits and simulate their output on an ideal noiseless quantum computer.\n",

    "## Quantum circuits\n",
    "\n",
    "The Qiskit programming model is based on **quantum circuits**. A **quantum circuit** is the quantum-computing analogue of a classical logic circuit.\n",
    "\n",
    "A circuit begins with a **register** of $n$ **qubits** which, by convention, are initialised in the state $\\ket{0}^{\\otimes n}$ (i.e. $\\ket{0\\dots 0}$).\n",
    "The programme is defined by specifying a sequence of unitary quantum-logic **gates** acting on one **or** more qubits.\n",
    "To extract classical information, the qubits are measured in the computational basis $\\{\\ket{0},\\ket{1}\\}$; the outcomes are stored in a classical register of $n$ **bits**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because every gate is unitary, the overall evolution preserves the norm of the state vector, ensuring that probabilities sum to one.  Designing an algorithm therefore amounts to choosing a gate sequence that steers the initial state towards one which, when measured, solves the task at hand with high probability.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Create a quantum `QuantumCircuit` object with a register of `n` qubits and a classical register of (typically) `n` bits, where the classical registers store the read-out state of each qubit.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Construct the quantum circuit, specifying the application of quantum gates and measurement operations on particular qubits.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Transpile the circuit to run on a target backend—either a simulator or real hardware. Transpilation optimizes the circuit and expresses it in the \"native-gate\" set of the target. Transpilers for real (noisy) hardware will also work to minimize circuit depth and error rates by accounting for the relative fidelity and physical layout of the qubits on the QPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Submit the circuit to the device, which is executed repeatedly to collect results for a specified number of shots, sampling the quantum distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Retrieve the results, which are formatted as a dictionary of bitstrings and counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Post-process the results for the next stage of computation or human interpretability."
